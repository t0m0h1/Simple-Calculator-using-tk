# Simple-Calculator-using-tk

a tk window which simulates a standard arithmetic calculator by performing operations.


This program was built using the the python Tkinter Package, a GUI toolkit used for basic graphic windows.

The aim of this project is to build my own calculator GUI which looks similar to a website calculator/ widget, i've always liked the practicality as they let you solve maths operations without having to navigate to sites or use a pocket (solid state) calculator, which lets you keep your work open (theoretically).
